# BroadCasting Chat System using C Socket Programming

## Description
This project is designed to build a chat system where a single client can broadcast to all other client through server.

The project includes knowledge of threading such that multiple client works independently.

## Requirement and Experimental setup
1. Operating System : Windows
2. 
3. Must have a C/C++ Compiler

## How to Run
1. Compile separately server and client on different terminal.

2. If we want to have 3 client you have to compile 4 times, one for server and other three for clients such that all executable should be different and on different terminals.

3. Pass the command line argument if asked for.

4. Finally start the chat.

5. Chat will end as you write the message quit sent through the server.
